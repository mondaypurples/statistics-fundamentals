This repo contains knowledge about the kinds of problems we can solve with Statistics.

- Firstly, we will focus on the details around getting data for analysis
- Understand how the data is structured and measured
- Organize data in comprehensible forms (frequency and grouped frequency tables) to find patterns
- Visualize the patterns

Learnings:

- Sampling
- Variables in Statistics
- Frequency Distributions
- Visualizing Frequency Distributions
- Comparing Frequency Distributions

Project: 
Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings - Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?

Background:
Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator. It displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars. In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. He published his analysis in this article here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/

The distribution of displayed ratings is clearly shifted to the right compared to the actual rating distribution, suggesting strongly that Fandango inflates the ratings under the hood.

Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system and not intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible.

In this project, we analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
